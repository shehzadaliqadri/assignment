    <h1>Anti-money laundering violations: US slaps Rs9.69 bn fine on Pakistan state-run bank</h1>
    <p><cite>ISLAMABAD: The US's Federal Reserve Board on Thursday announced a $55 million (Rs9.69 billion)
            penalty
            against the
            National Bank of Pakistan, operating in the United States and headquartered in Pakistan, for anti-money
            laundering
            violations. The Board will also require the firm to improve its anti-money laundering programme.</cite></p>

    <br />
    <p><cite>It is the second Pakistani bank which had come under scrutiny. It was announced when the Financial Action
            Task Force
            (FATF) was evaluating Pakistan's compliance on money laundering and counter-terror financing in its ongoing
            plenary
            meeting in Paris.

            According to the announcement, as detailed in the consent cease and desist order against the National Bank
            of Pakistan,
            the firm’s US banking operations did not maintain an effective risk management programme or controls
            sufficient to
            comply with anti-money laundering laws. The Board’s action is in conjunction with an action by the New York
            State
            Department of Financial Services.

            In its detailed version, the Federal Reserve Board stated that within 60 days of this order, the bank and
            the branch
            shall jointly submit a written programme acceptable to the Reserve Bank and reasonably designed to ensure
            the
            identification and timely, accurate, and complete reporting by the branch of all known or suspected
            violations of law or
            suspicious transactions to the law enforcement and supervisory authorities, as required by applicable
            suspicious
            activity reporting laws and regulations.

            In addition, the programme shall include the items, such as a well-documented methodology for establishing
            monitoring
            rules and thresholds appropriate for the branch’s risk profile, which considers factors, such as type of
            customer, type
            of product or service, geographic location, and foreign correspondent banking activities, including the US
            dollar
            clearing activities and policies and procedures for analysing, testing, and documenting changes to
            monitoring rules and
            thresholds. This reporter tried to get a version from the NBP but got no response.</cite></p>
